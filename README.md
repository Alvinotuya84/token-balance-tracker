To run this program, you need to have node.js installed in your computer.


## Setting UP The Project

Make sure npm or yarn is installed in your machine, run the development server:

create a new folder called files in the root of the project directory.

## Running the project


To calculate the portfolio value, run either of the following command:


$ node ./build/portfolio <date_string> <token_symbol>
example:
node ./build/portfolio 2022-01-01 BTC

$ node ./build/portfolio <token_symbol>
example:
node ./build/portfolio  BTC

$ node ./build/portfolio


Note:
I create a react interface for the same project which reads directly from cryptocompare api and provides the rate according to date and token symbol provided
Thank you very much for the opportunity
Looking to hearing back from you
Cheers!
